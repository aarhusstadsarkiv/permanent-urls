# permanent-urls

This repository contains and generates permanent URLs for the Aarhus City Archives.

Usage could be QR codes. The QR code could be printed on a physical object, e.g. a bridge, a building, a statue, a sign, etc. The QR code could be scanned by a mobile device, which would take the user to the permanent URL - and then this URL would redirect the user to the real URL. This way, the real URL could be changed without having to change the QR code.

    QR code -> permanent URL -> real URL

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:aarhusstadsarkiv/permanent-urls.git
    uv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    uv sync

## URL generation and update

The redirect URLs should be placed in the [bin/redirects.csv](bin/redirects.csv) file.

The `File` column is the filename of the permanent URL. The `URL` column is the URL where the client will be redirected.

You may add a new permanent URL by adding a new line to this CSV file. Then run the following command to generate the new redirect file(s). 

    ./bin/update_purls.py

Now you can `commit` and `push` the changes with the new and updated files.

Your new permanent URLs will be available at an address like the following:

    https://purl.aarhusstadsarkiv.dk/<file-name>

> The <file-name> is auto-generated by the `update_purls.py` script. It is a random string of 7 characters (letters and numbers) followed by `.html`.

E.g.:

https://purl.aarhusstadsarkiv.dk/0taceun.html

In order to generate a QR for a permanent URL, you may use a service like [qr.io](https://qr.io/)

## Import from CSV

If you need to add multiple lines you may use a `csv` file (e.g. when importing from external sources like excel). 
The following command will add `URLs` (and generate `File` names ) based on the column with index 2 (0 index based counting) of the `bin/import.csv` file. 

    ./bin/import_from_csv.py bin/import.csv 2

## Check URLs

You will need to copy `bin/config-dist.js` to `bin/config.js` and add your mattermost webhook URL
to the `bin/config.js` file.

Then check all URLs by using the following command.

    node bin/check-urls.js

Or in a cron job (which in this case will run every  hour at minute 0):

    0 * * * * cd /home/user/permanent-urls && node bin/check-urls.js
